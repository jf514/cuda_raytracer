# Cuda Raytracer: cuda_raytracer (Work in Progress)

This is a simple GPU accelerated raytracer, using CUDA, as the final project CSE 272 at UCSD. The goals are teaching myself raytracing, and CUDA.

Many elements are borrowed from:
-[Raytracing in a Single Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/)
-[UCSD LaJolla Renderer](https://github.com/BachiLi/lajolla_public)
-[PBRT](https://pbrt.org/)
-[Accelerated Raytracing in One Weekend in CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/accelerated-ray-tracing-cuda/).
